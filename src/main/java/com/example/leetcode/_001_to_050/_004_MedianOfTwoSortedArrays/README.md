## 4\. Median of Two com.example.leetcode.sorted Arrays

    There are two com.example.leetcode.sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

    Find the median of the two com.example.leetcode.sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

    Example 1:

        nums1 = [1, 3]
        nums2 = [2]

        The median is 2.0

    Example 2:

        nums1 = [1, 2]
        nums2 = [3, 4]

        The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
