## 119\. Pascal's Triangle II

    Given an index k, return the kth row of the Pascal's triangle.

    For example, given k = 3,
      
      Return [1,3,3,1].
      
    Note:
  
      Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?
     
  
    Pascal's triangle:
  
                1
              1 2 1
             1 3 3 1
            1 4 6 4 1
